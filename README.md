# PASTA
Soon we will present a paper that improves on pre-processing for 
the SPDZ and MiniMacs protocols [SPDZ12,DZ13] in the arithmetic setting. 
This project provides tools for the general public to use our result in
connection with those protocols.

TODO(rwz): List which tools/programs we provide and what they can do for
clients.

TODO(rwz): write how to build and run the tools.
